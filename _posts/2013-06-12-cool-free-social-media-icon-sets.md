Social Media Icon Sets are always usefull, as every website has its own design, thus needs its own social media icons. During my work on some website-projects, i created three free Social Media Icon Sets. They are containing icons for: Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, Youtube, Pinterest, Linkedin, RSS-feeds and for email.The first set is based on a lovely rainy leave, which i took a picture of this sping. The second social media icon set imitates a rough stone or steel pattern. In contrast the last set has a basic shape, like it has been drawn with a pencil.

So here are some previews:

## Download your free Social Media Icon Sets now!

I packed all of them in a zip-archive. It contains the above icons in a 64px and 128px version, plus a larger version, which you can resize due to your own needs.They are in .jpg and .png format so ready to use for your website.

I recommend using the rainy icons with a minimum of 128 pixels, as they are optimized for this size, if you use them in a smaller size, just color the letters with higher contrast. Contact me, if you need the original Photoshop-File.

Download the [Social\_Media\_Icon_Sets]({{ site.url }}/assets/socialmediaicons/Social_Media_Icons.zip) as a Zip-Archive.
