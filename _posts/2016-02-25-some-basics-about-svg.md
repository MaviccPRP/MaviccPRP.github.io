In this tutorial I will introduce you to the XML-based image format SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). SVG is adviced by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "World Wide Web Consortium") (W3C) and developed since 1999. To get in touch with this technology, I will show you some basic examples, how to use SVG in your HTML documents. I will explain basic shapes you can create with SVG and give you some links to further dive into this wide topic.
  
SVG is a wonderful way of implementing Images into your website. It is small in size, delivers sharp Images and is widely supported by browsers. For further reading I advice you the following links:
