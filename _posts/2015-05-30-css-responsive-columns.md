    In this tutorial about creating responsive columns, we will talk about the CSS attribute &#8218;columns&#8216;. With that you can define columns on your contents, to give your users some kind of a newspaper experience.<br /> But with CSS columns you can even setup a responsive column design. The columns are changing its appearance according to the width of the screen, without setting up any media queries.

    Finally you can easily create a resposnive HTML list or navigation. But what is best, the cross browser support for this attribute is rather extensive, if you do not use more advanced commands.
