In this tutorial we will have a look at CSS gradients. With the gradient functionality you can design colourful web pages with just a few lines of CSS. CSS gradients are generating an image, with gradient effects.

Particularly we will have a look at the linear-gradient and the radial-gradient function. I will introduce the most important use cases, to enable you to start with CSS gradients on your own.

As always I use JSbin (www.jsbin.com).for this tutorial.

If you want to know more about CSS gradients, just have a look at the following web pages:
