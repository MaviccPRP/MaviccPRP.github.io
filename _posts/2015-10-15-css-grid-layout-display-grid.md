In this tutorial I will give you some insights into the future of CSS. With CSS Grid Layout &#8211; display: grid you will have more control over your layouts. You can forget the rather confusing float or inline-block systems of CSS. With display: grid design and structure is even better separated.
  
This tutorial is not a complete guide to this new feature, but will give you the ability, to experiment with the grid layout and explore it on your own.

As always I am using the great JSBin tool to visualize this CSS feature:
