In this short tutorial, we are talking about CSS pseudo-elements and will have a look at pseudo-classes, as well. As an example I will focus on the folowwing pseudo-elements:
  
1. after and before
  
2. first-letter
  
3. first-line

To understand the high flexibility of these pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, I show you, how to combine these two CSS features.

For a deeper look I advice you to go to the Mozilla documentation:

As always, I am using the amazing JSBin tool for this tutorial.
